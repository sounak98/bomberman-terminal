This version of Bomberman can be played by first selecting the level
and then using w/a/s/d or i/j/k/l for up/left/down/right respectively.
q can be used to quit from the game and x is used to place the bomb.
Each bomb detonates after 4 seconds approximately. Higher levels have
higher speeds of monsters and more number of monsters too.

The game can be run using the executable script run.py.
